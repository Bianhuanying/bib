abstract = {Water infiltration into the unsaturated zone is potentially affected by air compression ahead of the wetting front. Analytical infiltration equations accounting for air compression, air counterflow, and flow hysteresis in a porous medium were derived on the basis of the Green and Ampt [1911] assumptions. Air compression ahead of the wetting front was predicted using the perfect gas law. The capillary pressure at the wetting front was found to vary between the dynamic water-bubbling value and the dynamic air-bubbling value of the material. These equations, accounting also for the effects of macropores near the soil surface, turned out to be simpler than the traditional Kostiakov [1932] and the Philip [1957a, b, c, d] equations. The equation parameters are physically meaningful and can be readily obtained from field measurements of the natural saturated hydraulic conductivity and soil water retention or pressure infiltrometer data. Experimental testing showed that the equations are reasonably accurate.},

    abstract = { Infiltration into soils is affected by several factors, including the soil‐air pressure. Soil air may become compressed between a confining layer (water table) and a nearly saturated surface soil. Compressed and counterflowing air substantially reduces soil infiltration rates resulting in potential practical problems of excess runoff and erosion. Using results from laboratory column studies, we describe a simple set of infiltration equations to predict infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration. Infiltration rates progressively declined in bounded soil columns until the soil‐air pressure head exceeded the sum of the ponded water depth and the capillary driving head at the wetting front. After a brief transition period during which stable air channels formed in the porous media, the infiltration rate approached a constant value. We demonstrate a simple method to predict this stable infiltration rate based on the permeability‐saturation relationship for the soil. Finally, we illustrate that the reduction in cumulative infiltration in bounded soils is roughly proportional to the water‐table depth, and that this reduction is greater in sands as compared to loamy soils. }

abstract = {Water sometimes infiltrates into a sandy soil along preferential flow paths called fingers, rather than homogeneously. In order to understand the physical fundamentals of fingering flow, we carried out two-dimensional infiltration tests under continuous rainfall. Each finger was composed of two moisture structure zones, a finger core and a finger-swelling zone surrounding the finger core. Each finger can be classified as a low-swell finger (LSF) or a high-swell finger (HSF) based on the swelling velocity. In LSF, water moves laterally across a constant potential boundary where sorptivity is a dominant factor in making the finger swell. In HSF, on the other hand, water moves laterally through a constant flux boundary where pressure gradient is a driving force. In the latter, accordingly, the corresponding water flux can be estimated by the hydraulic conductivity multiplied by the water pressure gradient. Based on these observations, we propose a growth model for a finger moving downward along with subsequent lateral expansion, which makes it possible to estimate the area of soil wetted by fingers. The estimated area is in a fairly good agreement with that observed.}

abstract = {Unstable flow causes major uncertainties in the characterization of drainage in the vadose zone by inducing finger-like flow paths in soils with or without macropores. Recent studies have identified the major factors governing fingered flow to be the combined effects of capillary hysteresis, the existence of a threshold water-entry value in a porous medium, and a positive matric potential gradient behind the wetting front. This situation typically occurs during redistribution following high-rate infiltration, a common occurrence in hydrology. The conditions favoring instability can also develop during infiltration into a fine-over-coarse layered soil, into hydrophobic or air-entrapped soils, or even in a homogeneous coarse-textured soil if the infiltration rate is low. An analysis of the conditions necessary for the onset of unstable flow in a uniform soil is provided in this paper. We demonstrate that if the matric potential gradient (dh/dz) becomes positive during redistribution, a perturbation at the wetting front will cause finger flow. However, if dh/dz remains negative, the perturbation will be dissipated. The analysis is used to predict a critical depth of irrigation (Ic) beyond which the flow should become unstable. A series of point-source and line-source infiltration experiments were conducted using a slab-box filled with uniform sands. The results confirmed that as soon as Ic is exceeded, a finger was formed at the bottom of the wetting front, channeling the flow and stopping water movement in the surrounding areas. We discuss this phenomenon's implications for practical irrigation and leaching designs.},

abstract = {A conceptual model is presented that represents the development of unstable flow in uniform soils during redistribution. The flow instability results in the propagation of fingers that drain water from the wetted soil matrix until equilibrium is reached. The model uses soil retention and hydraulic functions, plus relationships describing finger size and spatial frequency. The model assumes that all soils are unstable during redistribution, but shows that only coarse-textured soils will form fingers capable of moving appreciable distances. Once it forms, a finger moves downward at a rate governed by the rate of loss of water from the soil matrix, which can be predicted from the hydraulic conductivity function. Fingers are assumed to stay narrow as a result of hysteresis, which prevents lateral diffusion. The draining front in the soil matrix between the fingers is assumed to cease downward movement because water pressure drops below the threshold water-entry matric potential. The threshold potential is not present in the conventional Richards equation of soil water flow, which explains why unstable flow is not predicted by widely used simulation model codes.},

A two-dimensional transparent chamber (41.5cm wide, 50cm high and 2.8cm thick) was constructed for infiltration experiments using three water-repellent Ouddorp sands (The Netherlands) and a wettable silicon sand. The results showed that if the water-ponding depth (h0) at the soil surface was lower than the water-entry value (hwe) of repellent sands, infiltration would not start until the water drop penetration time (WDPT) is exceeded; and contrary to infiltration in wettable soils, the infiltration rate increased with time. However, infiltration could immediately start at any time when h0>hwe. The wetting front was unconditionally unstable for h0<hwe, resulting in fingered flow. However, the flow was conditionally stable for h0>hwe if the soil was not layered in a fine-over-coarse or wettable-over-repellent configuration, and if soil air was not compressed during infiltration. The occurrence of stable and unstable flow in repellent soils was consistent with the prediction based on a linear instability analysis. The findings can be used to improve irrigation efficiencies in water repellent soils, e.g. using high-ponding irrigation methods.}

We have measured the evolution of preferential flow paths in a slab of sandy soil using an array of tensiometers and light transmission. The pressure and water content measurements show that the nonuniform moisture content exists even when the potentials are equalized horizontally and that then are the result of hysteresis in the soil's pressure-saturation relationship. The equalization of potential takes place over several days, if at all, and is consistent, initially, with estimates of vapor transport out of the finger cores. Once the soil is wet enough, the remainder of water movement takes place in liquid films. Hysteresis produces another interesting situation when the pack is drained. We find that the wetter portions of the soil can be at a lower potential than the drier portions, resulting in a horizontal driving force for a flow of water from the drier to the wetter soil.},

In order to establish a physical model leading to stable (uniform) and unstable (non-uniform fingering) flows in unsaturated soils, two-dimensional tests on continuous rainfall infiltration were carried out by changing not only the initial water content (air dry, 0.5%, 1.0%) but also the rainfall intensity (15, 30, 180 mm/h). The physical mechanism of fingering flow was discussed on the basis of precise suction measurements inside and outside the fingers. The results show that wetting fronts developed in unsaturated sandy soils can be classified into three types; 1) fingering flow, 2) wavy front, and 3) plane front. Two types of fingering flow can be further distinguished by the difference of the swelling velocity; i.e., low-swell finger and high-swell finger flows. In each of the low-swell and high-swell fingers, a core and a swelling zone are developed while a finger is growing. Based on suction measurements inside them, it is found that the water condition in the finger core changes from wetting to drying processes while the water condition in the swelling zone remains in the wetting process. This hysteretic behavior in the core can be explained by the moisture distribution changing along a finger from tip to tail. Fingers swell when water moves from a finger core to surrounding dry sand. Such a swelling process is mainly controlled by the hydraulic conductivity for the wetting process at a finger tail.}

abstract = {Preferential flow in the field might be caused by various factors and is difficult to observe in situ. This experimental study was designed to identify the combined effects of air entrapment, surface desaturation (suction head), soil layering, and water repellency (hydrophobicity) of the porous media on unstable preferential flow (or fingering) in the vadose zone. The predictability of unstable flow was studied on the basis of two existing criteria for gravity fingering: (1) a velocity criterion proposed by Hill and Parlange [1972] and (2) a pressure head criterion by Raats [1973] and Philip [1975]. Two-dimensional transparent chambers (60 cm high, 41.5 cm wide, and 2.8 cm thick and 90 cm deep, 74.5 cm wide, and 1.8 cm thick) were used to visualize water infiltration into a water-wettable sand, a water-wettable loam, differently layered sand and loam, and a water-repellent sand. The results suggested that infiltration into the homogeneous sand and a sand-over-loam system, without the effects of air entrapment and surface desaturation, was unconditionally stable. Infiltration into the loam was also stable as observed in the limited chambers. The flow was unconditionally unstable in a fine-over-coarse stratified sublayer and conditionally unstable in the homogeneous sand under the effects of air entrapment and surface desaturation. In multiple-layered systems, infiltration flow was semiunstable; fingers developed in the sand layer and were stabilized in the loam. In the repellent sand the wetting front was unstable under low ponding conditions; however, it was stabilized when the ponding depth exceeded the water-bubbling (entry) value of the hydrophobic medium. Both the velocity and pressure head criteria predicted fingering in the sand (layers) with the effects of gravity. However, the criteria failed to predict stable flow in the loam, indicating that the capillary (stabilizing) effects on the flow need to be included in theoretical developments. Finally, the observed width and speed of the fingers and the system flux were found to be always higher under air-draining fingering conditions than with fingering under air-confined conditions.},

  abstract = {Experiments were conducted to quantify the effects of entrapped air on water infiltration into a loamy sand. Transparent three-dimensional (3-D) and 2-D columns were used for experiments carried out for two infiltration conditions: (1) when air was free to move ahead of the wetting front and leave the bottom of the column (air draining) and (2) when air was confined ahead of the wetting front and hence could escape only through the soil surface (air confining). The measurement setup was composed of a tension- pressure infiltrometer, an air flowmeter, water manometers, and video-picture cameras. We applied both positive and negative water pressures at the soil surface and measured the simultaneous changes in the rates of water inflow and air outflow, the air pressure ahead of the wetting front, and the dynamic behavior and advance of the wetting front. The air pressure ahead of the wetting front for the air-confining condition was generally found to increase with time rather than reaching a constant level, as observed in other studies by other researchers. The air pressure fluctuated locally because of air escaping from the soil surface. On the basis of an analysis of the results we present two empirical equations to predict the maximum air pressure at which air begins to erupt from the soil surface and to predict the minimum air pressure at which air eruption stops. We found that the infiltration rate was always equal to, and controlled by, the rate of air outflow. The infiltration rate varied inversely with the air pressure ahead of the wetting front and with the ponding depth at the soil surface. The infiltration rate fluctuated with time rather than undergoing changes in a three-stage process, as is often characterized in the literature. The volume of residual entrapped air in the air-confining condition increased 7% on average, and the infiltration rate decreased threefold to tenfold as compared to the air-draining condition. Finally, it was shown that the air-confining infiltration flow is fingered and unstable, consistent with the predictions of an existing theory. },

A distinction between “potential” and “actual” water repellency and the assessment of the “critical soil water content” are introduced and highlighted in this paper. Persistence and degree of potential water repellency of dried samples were examined from 10 trenches in a dune sand with grass cover using the water drop penetration time and the alcohol percentage tests. The spatial variability of water repellency and, therefore, soil wetting was extremely high. The actual water repellency was measured on field-moist samples to obtain critical soil water contents.

This flow in the upper layer, which is of major importance in the spatial distribution of water and solutes in field soils, is generally not considered, and is introduced here as “distribution flow.” The preferential flow paths are separated by dry soil bodies, which are highly persistent due to their extremely water repellent character and their low hydraulic conductivity.

When the conductivity of a coarse-textured sublayer at its effective water-entry suction is greater than the rate of transmission through a finer-textured top layer, the flow velocity increases across the interlayer plane. Thereupon, a spatially-distributed flow field in the top layer will tend to constrict, forming spatially separated streams (fingers) in the sublayer. To test the hypothesis, ponded infiltration experiments were conducted in transparent laboratory chambers packed with air-dry sands. The hydraulic properties of the media were determined by equilibrium capillary rise, parameter estimation, and horizontal absorption experiments. Dynamic measurements of flux and suction at the interlayer plane during infiltration revealed that the effective water-entry suction is characteristic of the predominant pore size in the sublayer and can be predicted from its median particle size (r2 = 0.99). Predictions regarding the onset of fingering and the wetted fractional volume of fingers were both validated for the monodisperse and polydisperse sublayers studied.},

  abstract = {Abstract A rigorous hydrodynamic stability analysis of the delta-function model of infiltration is developed. Raats recently proposed as the criterion for instability that wetting front velocity should increase with front penetration. This detailed analysis, on the other hand, shows that the fundamental criterion is that the water pressure gradient immediately behind the front should oppose the flow. The two criteria agree only in the special case where five significant parameters of the system are all constant and independent of depth, or of depth to the front. The Raats criterion fails in the various more general cases with one or more of these quantities variable. Quantitative criteria are developed for various specific circumstances in which the flow may become unstable: penetration to a non-wetting stratum; compression of air ahead of the front; redistribution following infiltration; increase of conductivity with depth. The analysis indicates a definite maximum wave number for unstable disturbances, Mcrit, and a wave number for disturbances which are amplified most rapidly, 3-½ Mcrit. Flows in a laboratory soil column may therefore remain stable because the cross-sectional dimensions are too small. Observed dimensions of fingers in unstable infiltration flows are consistent with the predicted wave number for maximum amplification. The study is readily extended to time-dependent flows of two immiscible fluids in heterogeneous media. It applies also to time-dependent flows in heterogeneous Hele-Shaw cells. Care should be exercised in applying results for the deltafunction model to flows with gradual wetting fronts, especially when nonwetting strata are involved.},
