We design and numerically validate a recovery based linear finite element method for solving the biharmonic equation. The main idea is to replace the gradient operator $\nabla$ on linear finite element space by $G(\nabla)$ in the weak formulation of the biharmonic equation, where $G$ is the recovery operator which recovers the piecewise constant function into the linear finite element space. By operator $G$, Laplace operator $\Delta$ is replaced by $\nabla\cdot G(\nabla)$. Furthermore, the boundary condition on normal derivative $\nabla u\cdot \pmb{n}$ is treated by the boundary penalty method. The explicit matrix expression of the proposed method is also introduced. Numerical examples on the uniform and adaptive meshes are presented to illustrate the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed method.

abstract = {Wetting front instability and gravity-driven fingers can occur during infiltration in sandy soil. These soils overlay many major aquifers. Finger width and velocity are important parameters in predicting the risk of groundwater pollution in these soils. In previous studies, closed-form solutions were developed for air dry soil. In uniformly wet soils, where the fingers are much wider, predictive finger width equations have failed so far. In this paper we simplify further the Parlange-Hill closed-form solution for dry soil and show that, by taking hysteresis into account, it applies to fingers emanating from a point source in a sandy test soil at two widely different moisture contents.},

	abstract = {Infiltration into well-sorted sands can show an anomalous behavior called saturation overshoot where the saturation at the infiltrating front is higher than the saturation behind the front for certain fluxes and initial water contents. Similarly, capillary pressure overshoot is defined as when the capillary pressure is greater behind the front than it is at the front, which is contrary to normal infiltration. In this paper, pressure profiles are reported for water infiltrating into sand for a range of fluxes and initial water content. Capillary pressure overshoot is observed for sands with an initial water saturation of 0.06 and less, while no overshoot is observed for greater initial saturations. Capillary pressure overshoot does not show much dependence on flux, but the capillary pressure at the front does decrease with increasing flux. These results are combined with the previous saturation measurements, and it is found that the capillary pressure-saturation imbibition curve is not dependent on the velocity of the front. The implications of the results on the stability of three-dimensional flows are discussed.},

	abstract = {Gravity-driven multiphase flow in porous media is ubiquitous in the geophysical world; the classic case in hydrology is vertical infiltration of precipitation into a soil. For homogenous porous media, infiltrations are sometimes observed to be stable and laterally uniform, but other times are observed to be unstable and produce preferential flow paths. Since Saffman and Taylor (1958), researchers have attempted to define criteria that determine instability. Saffman and Taylor's analysis consisted of two regions of single phase flow, while Parlange and Hill (1976) integrated this analysis with the multiphase flow equations to provide testable predictions. In the subsequent 40 years, great advances have been made determining the complex interactions between multiphase flow and instability. Theoretically, the stability of the standard multiphase flow equations has been verified, showing the necessity of extensions to the multiphase flow equations to describe the observed unstable flow. Experimentally, it has been shown that the instability is related to a phenomena in 1-D infiltrations called saturation or pressure overshoot. In this review, the connection between overshoot and instability is detailed, and it is described how models of overshoot can simplify the analysis of current and future models of instability and multiphase flow.},

	abstract = "In practice, there are three types of adaptive methods using the finite element approach, namely the h-method, p-method, and r-method. In the h-method, the overall method contains two parts, a solution algorithm and a mesh selection algorithm. These two parts are independent of each other in the sense that the change of the PDEs will affect the first part only. However, in some of the existing versions of the r-method (also known as the moving mesh method), these two parts are strongly associated with each other and as a result any change of the PDEs will result in the rewriting of the whole code. In this work, we will propose a moving mesh method which also contains two parts, a solution algorithm and a mesh-redistribution algorithm. Our efforts are to keep the advantages of the r-method (e.g., keep the number of nodes unchanged) and of the h-method (e.g., the two parts in the code are independent). A framework for adaptive meshes based on the Hamiltonâ€“Schoenâ€“Yau theory was proposed by Dvinsky. In this work, we will extend Dvinsky's method to provide an efficient solver for the mesh-redistribution algorithm. The key idea is to construct the harmonic map between the physical space and a parameter space by an iteration procedure. Each iteration step is to move the mesh closer to the harmonic map. This procedure is simple and easy to program and also enables us to keep the map harmonic even after long times of numerical integration. The numerical schemes are applied to a number of test problems in two dimensions. It is observed that the mesh-redistribution strategy based on the harmonic maps adapts the mesh extremely well to the solution without producing skew elements for multi-dimensional computations."

These instabilities play a very important role during carbon sequestration processes in brine aquifers. Our approach is based on a nonlinear implementation of the discontinuous Galerkin method, and possesses a number of key features. First, the method developed is inherently high order, and is therefore well suited to study unstable flow mechanisms. Secondly, it maintains high-order accuracy on completely unstructured meshes. The combination of these two features makes it a very appealing strategy in simulating the challenging flow patterns and very complex geometries of actual reservoirs and aquifers. This article includes an extensive set of verification studies on the stability and accuracy of the method, and also features a number of computations with unstructured grids and non-standard geometries."

There is a need for fully two-dimensional simulations to compare with experimental data. To this end, a numerical scheme is presented for a lubrication model derived for particle-laden thin film flow in two dimensions with surface tension. The scheme relies on an ADI process to handle the higher-order terms, and an iterative procedure to improve the solution at each timestep. This is the first paper to simulate the two-dimensional particle-laden thin film lubrication model. Several aspects of the scheme are examined for a test problem, such as the timestep, runtime, and number of iterations. The results from the simulation are compared to experimental data. The simulation shows good qualitative agreement. It also suggests further lines of inquiry for the physical model."

As published in a number of recent papers, finger-like solutions with nonmonotonic profiles can be simulated numerically using a downwind averaging method. However, we find these fingers to be artifacts, generated by the combined effects of a truncation error induced oscillation or oversaturation at the wetting front, and capillary hysteresis. As the oscillation is removed, either through grid refinement or the use of inherently monotone schemes, the numerically generated fingers disappear, and the solution becomes monotonic. Thus the RE along with standard monotonic hydraulic properties does not contain the critical physics required to model gravity-driven fingers and must be considered inadequate for unsaturated flow in initially dry, highly nonlinear, and hysteretic media where these fingers occur.},

In the first case, the permeability function k can be degenerate, but the initial saturation does not take the critical values. In the second case, the permeability function k is strictly positive, but the capillary pressure function can be multi-valued. In both cases, the degenerate behavior of pc leads to the physically desired uniform bounds for the saturation variable. Our approach exploits maximum principles and relies on the corresponding uniform bounds for pressure and saturation. A new compactness result for the saturation variable allows to take limits in nonlinear terms. The solution concept uses tools of convex analysis."

In particular, such solutions may have non monotonic profiles, which are ruled out when considering standard, equilibrium type models, but have been observed experimentally. The paper ends with numerical experiments confirming the theoretical results."

Both water content and matric potential were measured. Water content was measured with Synchrotron X-rays at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) and matric potential with fast responding tensiometers. The flow field changed gradually from unstable fingered flow at 0% initial water content to a wetting pattern that can be described with Richards’ equation without hysteresis. For unstable flow, the matric potential and water content decreased a short distance behind the wetting front. Except in the initially dry soil, the finger pattern began to widen immediately after infiltration. The pressure and water content of the wetting front were hyperbolically related to the initial water content. In general, this research showed that in coarse soils when an unstable wetting front occurs both the matric potential and water content drop behind the wetting front while, when a stable Richards’ type wetting front forms, the matric potential and water content increase (slightly) behind the wetting front."

This advance offers the potential for improved understanding and modeling of multiphase flow processes. To provide background for this work, the traditional approach to describing two-phase flow in porous media is reviewed. The universally employed empirical extension of Darcy's Law for single-phase flow to two-phase flow situations is rejected as arbitrary and subject to severe shortcomings. Burial of dynamic effects into relative permeability and capillary pressure hysteresis is shown to be an unsatisfactory theoretical construct for modeling the actual processes occurring in two-phase flow. Examination of the traditional theory at equilibrium shows that interfacial forces actually present in multiphase systems have been overlooked causing the theory to provide contradictory results. To overcome these problems, a general theory of two-phase flow is proposed that is based on the basic principles of mass, momentum, and energy conservation and the second law of thermodynamics. This theory accounts, in a systematic way, for interfacial forces that are known to have an important effect on the movement of fluid phases in a porous medium. A new equation of momentum balance accounting for the presence of interfaces and their energetics is developed. This equation reduces to Darcy's Law for the special case of single-phase flow. The extended theory has the potential to describe phenomena unaccounted for by the traditional theory and thus provides a basis for scientific understanding of the physics of two-phase flow. Application of the theory requires experimental study to ascertain the values and precise functional dependence of the constitutive coefficients that arise."

	abstract = {Capillary pressure plays a central role in the description of water flow in unsaturated soils. While capillarity is ubiquitous in unsaturated analyses, the theoretical basis and practical implications of capillarity in soils remain poorly understood. In most traditional treatments of capillary pressure, it is defined as the difference between pressures of phases, in this case air and water, and is assumed to be a function of saturation. Recent theories have indicated that capillary pressure should be given a more general thermodynamic definition, and its functional dependence should be generalized to include dynamic effects. Experimental evidence has slowly accumulated in the past decades to support a more general description of capillary pressure that includes dynamic effects. A review of these experiments shows that the coefficient arising in the theoretical analysis can be estimated from the reported data. The calculated values range from 104 to 107 kg (m s)−1 In addition, recently developed pore-scale models that simulate interface dynamics within a network of pores can also be used to estimate the appropriate dynamic coefficients. Analyses of experiments reported in the literature, and of simulations based on pore-scale models, indicate a range of dynamic coefficients that spans about three orders of magnitude. To examine whether these coefficients have any practical effects on larger-scale problems, continuum-scale simulators may be constructed in which the dynamic effects are included. These simulators may then be run to determine the range of coefficients for which discernable effects occur. Results from such simulations indicate that measured values of dynamic coefficients are within one order of magnitude of those values that produce significant effects in field simulations. This indicates that dynamic effects may be important for some field situations, and numerical simulators for unsaturated flow should generally include the additional term(s) associated with dynamic capillary pressure.},

In addition to the capillary and gravity terms within the traditional Richards equation, the HDE contains a hypodiffusive term that models an experimentally observed hold-back-pile-up (HBPU) effect and thus imparts nonmonotonicity at the wetting front. In its dimensionless form the HDE contains the dimensionless hypodiffusion number, NHD. As NHD increases, one-dimensional (1D) numerical solutions transition from monotonic to nonmonotonic. Considering the experimentally observed controls on GDF occurrence, as either the initial moisture content and applied flux increase or the material nonlinearity decreases, solutions undergo the required transition back to monotonic. Additional tests for horizontal imbibition and capillary rise show the HDE to yield the required monotonic response but display sharper fronts for NHD > 0. Finally, two-dimensional (2D) numerical solutions illustrate that in parameter space where the 1D HDE yields nonmonotonicity, in 2D it forms nonmonotonic GDF.},

Using these constitutive relationships, unstable flow theory developed for coarse grained soils can be used to predict the shape and water content distribution for water repellent soils. A practical result of this paper is that with a basic experimental setup, we can characterize the imbibing front behavior by measuring the water entry pressure and the imbibing soil characteristic curve from the same heat treated soil."

Preferential flow in water-repellent sands. Soil Sci. Soc. Am. J. 62, 1185–1190]. These experiments demonstrate that water repellency has a significant impact on the stability of flow. As a follow up to these experiments, numerical solutions of the Richards equation for a two-dimensional domain are derived to examine the effect of water repellency on flow characteristics. Of particular interest is the development of gravity-driven unstable flow conditions caused by water repellency. The degree of water repellency of the porous medium is manifested in the water saturation—capillary pressure and water saturation—hydraulic conductivity relationships for the porous medium. To derive the numerical solutions, parameters closely representing the flow domain boundary conditions and the porous medium properties in the experiments of Bauters et al., were employed. In this paper we present the results of simulations for two cases: a water wettable sand and an extremely water repellent sand. The numerical solution for the water wettable sand led to a stable flow condition, while for the water-repellent sand the flow was unstable as manifested by the development of a single finger of flow. A new feature of these modeling results, in comparison to previous modeling results for gravity-driven unstable flow, is that the water pressure inside the finger core is positive. In testing the numerical solutions we compared the solution results to the laboratory results in terms of flow patterns, water pressure at a single reference point, and wetting front velocity. The degree of agreement between the laboratory results and the numerical solutions in terms of these measures is quite good."

	abstract = {Abstract Water-repellent soils occur all over the world and affect both groundwater pollution and crop yield. The finger-like wetting patterns in these soils have many similarities with unstable wetting fronts in coarse-grained sandy soils. Our objectives were to study the water movement in water-repellent sand and to examine how the theory for unstable wetting fronts applies to water-repellent sands. Infiltration experiments, in which moisture content and matric potentials were measured, were carried out in slab chambers with identical sands but with different levels of water repellence. Soil water characteristics were determined in separate experiments. Infiltration in the hydrophilic soil resulted in a uniform and horizontal front. All water-repellent sands showed a fingered flow pattern. For negative water-entry values, water infiltrated without delay. For positive values, water entered the soil only after the depth of the ponded water equaled or exceeded the water-entry pressure, which increased with increasing repellency. The finger widths predicted with the unstable flow theory agreed rather well with the observed values. In general, the research showed that the wetting patterns of water-repellent sands depended directly on the soil water characteristic curve. This implies that the type of wetting front and risk to groundwater pollution can be predicted based on laboratory-measured soil hydraulic properties.},

	abstract = {Important features of multiphase flow in porous media that distinguish it from single-phase flow are the presence of interfaces between the fluid phases and of common lines where three phases come in contact. Despite this fact, mathematical descriptions of these flows have been lacking in rigor, consisting primarily of heuristic extensions of Darcy's law that include a hysteretic relation between capillary pressure and saturation and a relative permeability coefficient. As a result, the standard capillary pressure concept appears to have physically unrealistic properties. The present paper employs microscopic mass and momentum balance equations for phases and interfaces to develop an understanding of capillary pressure at the microscale. Next, the standard theories and approaches that define capillary pressure at the macroscale are described and their shortcomings are discussed. Finally, an approach is presented whereby capillary pressure is shown to be an intrinsic property of the system under study. In particular, the presence of interfaces and their distribution within a multiphase system are shown to be essential to describing the state of the system. A thermodynamic approach to the definition of capillary pressure provides a theoretically sound alternative to the definition of capillary pressure as a simple hysteretic function of saturation.},

	abstract = {Well-defined laboratory experiments have been carried out to investigate hysteretic dynamic effect in capillary pressure–saturation relationships for two-phase flow in homogeneous and heterogeneous (layered) porous media. Conceptually, the dependence of the capillary pressure curves on the rate of change of saturation (dSw/dt) is defined as the dynamic effect in capillary pressure relationship, which is indicated by a dynamic coefficient, τ (Pa s) and it determines the rate at which two-phase flow equilibrium is reached, i.e., dSw/dt = 0 where Sw and t are the water saturation and time, respectively. The dependences of τ on various fluid and porous materials properties have been studied in the context of drainage; but, there is limited study for imbibition and the hysteresis of τ−Sw relationships. As such, the emphasis in this article is on reporting τ−Sw curves for imbibition while also demonstrating the hysteresis in the τ−Sw relationships by comparing τ−Sw curves for drainage (previously reported) and imbibition (this study) in carefully designed laboratory experiments. Homogeneous sand samples composed of either fine (small particle size and lower permeability) or coarse (larger particle size and higher permeability) sand have been used for these experiments. Furthermore, a layered domain made of a find sand layer sandwiched between two coarse sand layers is used as a model of heterogeneous domain. The results of the study confirm that the τ−Sw relationships are hysteretic in nature and, as such, the speed to flow equilibrium should vary depending on whether drainage or imbibition takes place. At a particular water saturation, the magnitudes of the dynamic coefficient (τ) are found to be generally higher for imbibition, which imply that the speed to flow equilibrium at the same saturation will be slower for imbibition. © 2013 The Authors.

	abstract = {Constant flux infiltration experiments were performed at rates less than saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) on uniform columns of soils and glass beads with low initial water contents. Tensiometers measured matric pressure (ψ) histories at various depths in the 0.05-m diameter, 0.73-m-tall columns. One of two devices applied the steady fluxes: one was a ceramic plate applicator that allowed monitoring of pressures above the plate, and the other was a rain applicator that sprinkled water uniformly over the surface. Two columns were used. One allowed destructive sampling for water content in a way that prevented postrun changes in water content. The other allowed prerun replacement of pore air with gases of different solubilities. Contrary to predictions based on the Richards equation, transmission zone ψ values passed through maxima, then decreased continuously as wetting fronts moved down columns. Such nonideal behavior was observed in Aiken silt loam, Hanfoird sandy loam, Delhi sand, Oakley sand, and glass beads. At an infiltration rate equal to 70\% of Ksat, values of ψ at 2, 5, and 8 cm depths in the glass beads column decreased an average of 52\% from their respective maxima in about 3 hours. In the soil columns the nonmonotonic behavior was less pronounced but statistically significant at all rates examined (3–59\% of Ksat). Matric pressure reversals were larger, and corresponding maxima higher, when a given rate was preceded by a series of step wise increasing rates. Tests of possible explanations provided no evidence to support hypotheses involving trapped-air dynamics, convective air flow, particle rearrangement, or experimental artifacts. The results cast doubt on the ability of the Richards equation to predict the course of constant flux infiltration including the initiation of runoff.},

In this work, constant-flux infiltrations into confined porous media (laterally smaller than the finger diameter, thus essentially one-dimensional) are found to produce saturation overshoot identical to that found in gravity-driven fingers. Light transmission is used to measure the saturation profiles as a function of infiltrating flux, porous media grain size, grain sphericity, and initial water saturation. Saturation overshoot is found to cease below a certain minimum infiltrating flux. This minimum flux depends greatly on the grain sphericity and initial water content of the media and slightly on the mean grain size. The observed saturation overshoot is inconsistent with a continuum description of porous media but qualitatively matches well observations and predictions from discrete pore-filling mechanisms. This suggests that pore-scale physics controls saturation overshoot and in turn gravity-driven fingering.},

The model is an extension of the traditional Richards equation, and it introduces a new term, a fourth-order derivative in space, but not a new parameter. We propose a scaling that links the magnitude of the new term to the relative strength of gravity-to-capillary forces already present in Richards' equation. We exploit the thermodynamic framework to design a flow potential that constrains the water saturation to be between 0 and 1, its physically admissible values. The model predicts a saturation overshoot at the wetting front, which is in good agreement with experimental measurements. Two-dimensional numerical simulations predict gravity fingers with the appearance and characteristics observed in visual laboratory experiments. A linear stability analysis of the model shows that there is a direct relation between saturation overshoot and the strength of the front instability. Therefore our theory supports the conjecture that saturation overshoot, a pileup of water at the wetting front, is a prerequisite for gravity fingering.},

In the present study the analysis is applied to the stability of several soil water systems some of which are potentially unstable. The first stage in the analysis requires the generation of water content and pressure head profiles using a computer-based numerical solution for the flow equation for unsaturated porous materials. These profiles permit the calculation of certain differential terms which appear in the specification of the coefficients required in the stability analysis. Results for the growth rate of imposed disturbances of wavelengths of 1, 5, and 25 cm together with the appropriate eigenvectors are presented for infiltration into a homogeneous profile, redistribution following infiltration, infiltration into a scale heterogeneous medium, and infiltration into a fine-over-coarse stratified profile. Although instability was expected for the redistribution, heterogeneous, and layered systems, the results, whilst showing a noticeable trend towards instability, did not predict the occurrence of such a condition. The reason for this is discussed, in particular the evidence which suggests that small amounts of initial water can have a significant effect on the damping-out of instabilities that otherwise would occur under dry initial conditions. Reference is made to a projected further paper documenting the effect of initial water content on wetting front instability and to the need for additional numerical studies at very low initial water contents.},

With this nonequilibrium relation the governing equation is referred to as the nonequilibrium Richards equation (NERE). For the special case where the nonequilibrium vanishes, the NERE reduces to the Richards equation (RE), the conventional governing equation for describing unsaturated flow. A generalized linear stability analysis of the RE shows that this equation is unconditionally stable and therefore not able to produce gravity-driven unstable flows for infinitesimal perturbations to the flow field. A much stronger result of unconditional stability for the RE is derived using a nonlinear stability analysis applicable to the general case of heterogeneous porous media. For the general case of the NERE model, results of a linear stability analysis show that the NERE model is conditionally stable, with lower-frequency perturbations being unstable. A result of this analysis is that the nonmonotonicity of the pressure and saturation profile is a requisite condition for flow instability.},

The models considered include the conventional Richards equation (RE), a sharp front Richards equation (SFRE) and an extended Richards equation (RRE). The first two models are based on the use of an equilibrium capillary pressure-saturation function, while the third model is derived using a dynamic capillary pressure-saturation function represented by a relaxation coefficient. A traveling wave solution was formulated for each of the governing equations and used as the basic solution of each model. The stability analysis was based on imposing a small perturbation to the basic solution. The RE model yields only the well-known monotonically decreasing saturation profile toward the wetting front, and the wetting front is unconditionally stable. The SFRE model by its nature has a monotonically increasing saturation profile toward the front and an abrupt drop to the initial saturation. This flow is unconditionally unstable. The RRE model is distinct from the others in that it is the only model that is able to produce truly non-monotonic saturation profiles. The wetting front for the RRE model is conditionally stable, i.e. stable for high frequency perturbations, and unstable otherwise. This leads to the existence of a wave-number for maximum amplification, which should relate to the dimensions of fingers in unstable flow."

	abstract = {This paper describes and interprets experimental studies of wetting front instability guided by the dimensional analysis presented in paper 1 (R.J. Glass et al., this issue). When a wetting front passes from a fine-textured layer of initially dry sand into an underlying coarse layer, the front breaks into fingers. A specially developed vertical slablike chamber and associated techniques were developed for the study of such fingering. The flow rate through the system is systematically varied by using different mean grain size separates for the upper layer (the same coarse separate being used for the bottom layer). Relationships between finger width, propagation velocity, moisture content, and flow rate through individual fingers are experimentally determined and related to the properties of the bottom layer and the flow rate through the system. The results are different than those found in a previous experimental study which used different techniques for sample preparation. Results obtained here agree with a formulation derived earlier by J-Y. Parlange and D.E. Hill (1976) through linear stability analysis.},

These equations account for mechanism of dynamic capillary pressure via a first order relaxation function. A form of the relaxation function for the dynamic capillary pressure-saturation relation is proposed based on physical reasoning and a semi-analytical solution to the flow equations. A mass conservative and computational efficient numerical solution to the coupled equations in two space dimensions is derived and applied to the simulation of gravity-driven unstable flow. Simulated fingers have all the morphological features of fingers observed in laboratory experiments. The results demonstrate that the dynamic capillary pressure mechanism causes initial destabilization of the flow, while the mechanism of capillary hysteresis leads to finger persistence."

The governing equations and corresponding numerical scheme are based on the work of Nieber et al.

The first part of the study takes an extensive look at the sensitivity of the finger solutions to certain key parameters in the model such as capillary shape parameter, initial saturation, and capillary relaxation coefficient. The second part is a comparison to published experimental results that demonstrates the ability of the model to capture realistic fingering behavior.},
