	The study on the fingering phenomenon has been playing an important role in understanding the mechanism of the fluid flow through the porous media. In this paper, a numerical method consisting of the Crank-Nicolson scheme for the temporal discretization and the finite element method for the spatial discretization is proposed for the relaxation non-equilibrium Richards equation in simulating the fingering phenomenon. Towards the efficiency and accuracy of the numerical simulations, a predictor-corrector process is used for resolving the nonlinearity of the equation, and an $h$-adaptive mesh method is introduced for accurately resolving the solution around the wetting front region, in which a heuristic a posteriori error indicator is designed for the purpose. In numerical simulations, a traveling wave solution of the governing equation is derived for checking the numerical convergence of the proposed method. The effectiveness of the $h$-adaptive method is also successfully demonstrated by numerical experiments. Finally the mechanism on generating fingers is discussed by numerically studying several examples.

Optimally ordered triangular factorization of sparse matrices is more efficient and offers other important computational advantages in some applications. With this method, direct solutions are computed from sparse matrix factors instead of from a full inverse matrix, thereby gaining a significant advantage in speed, computer memory requirements, and reduced round-off error. Improvements of tea to one or more in speed and problem size over present applications of the inverse can be achieved in many cases. Details of the method, numerical examples, and the results of a large problem are given.},  keywords={},

	any large matrix. The storage requirement for CSB is the same as that for the more-standard

	A,x is difficult. Benchmark results indicate that on one processor, the CSB algorithms

The method consists of a Newton iteration method to linearize the governing equations, and a geometrical multigrid method to solve the derived system. The non-oscillatory k-exact reconstruction was developed towards the high quality solution reconstruction, and h-adaptive method was introduced to handle the efficiency issue. To further improve the numerical method, we study the following two issues in detail in this paper. First, we test the new reconstruction patch for the element which locates on the domain boundary, which could improve the convergence of the steady state significantly. Second, the adjoint-based a posteriori error estimation is introduced for the h-adaptive method, which could deliver more efficient adaptive refinement of the mesh. The numerical tests show the effectiveness of the proposed method.}

	This chapter explains a mixed finite element method for the Biharmonic equation. One way to avoid the computational difficulty is to use a non-conforming method, in which the approximate solution lies in a finite-dimensional space. The other way to avoid the computational difficulty is based on a different variational principle called the standard variational formulation of problem. Different variational principle falls into two categories: either the variational principle is explicitly dependent upon a given triangulation of the set Ώ, in which case the method is called hybrid, or otherwise, it is called a mixed method. The chapter also discusses an approximate method related to yet another variational principle, in which the Laplacian Δu of the solution plays a special role.}

	abstract = {A new finite element method for fourth-order elliptic partial differential equations is presented and applied to thin bending theory problems in structural mechanics and to a strain gradient theory problem. The method combines concepts from the continuous Galerkin (CG) method, the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method and stabilization techniques. A brief review of the CG method, the DG method and stabilization techniques highlights the advantages and disadvantages of these methods and suggests a new approach for the solution of fourth-order elliptic problems. A continuous/discontinuous Galerkin (C/DG) method is proposed which uses C0-continuous interpolation functions and is formulated in the primary variable only. The advantage of this formulation over a more traditional mixed approach is that the introduction of additional unknowns and related difficulties can be avoided. In the context of thin bending theory, the C/DG method leads to a formulation where displacements are the only degrees of freedom, and no rotational degrees of freedom need to be considered. The main feature of the C/DG method is the weak enforcement of continuity of first and higher-order derivatives through stabilizing terms on interior boundaries. Consistency, stability and convergence of the method are shown analytically. Numerical experiments verify the theoretical results, and applications are presented for Bernoulli–Euler beam bending, Poisson–Kirchhoff plate bending and a shear layer problem using Toupin–Mindlin strain gradient theory.}

Based on a recent generalization of the Green-Ampt approach, a new theory for variably-saturated flow is presented that assumes that capillary pressure does not only depend on liquid content but also on the flow velocity. The Eulerian expression for the nonequilibrium capillary pressure is rotationally invariant and attempts to capture the conjecture that dynamic effects are more pronounced if flow is associated with moving fluid-fluid interfaces which cause a dynamic contact angle. The new theory correctly predicts how overshoot depends on the downstream and upstream liquid contents as well as on grain size. The theory also yields the hydrostatic pressure distribution in the liquid and allows for liquid contents exceeding the saturated liquid content of the main imbibition curve that may occur for overshoot.},

These transient curves depend on the magnitude of the imposed water content change and also on the speed with which static equilibrium is achieved after the change. The consequences of this behavior are discussed in terms of diffusion theory, and it is concluded that it would be unwise to apply this theory to desorption situations until the quantitative significance of this behavior is determined for other materials.},

A procedure was outlined for determining wetting diffusivities and conductivities in the wetting front on the basis of soil moisture profiles obtained during redistribution. The different shapes of the drying scanning tension curves provided some insight into the differences in particle size distribution that influence the water-holding capacity of soils.},

The Richards partial derivative equation is reduced to the ordinary one, which is easily integrated. Using simple kinematic relations nonmonotonic saturation-depth profiles travelling both in 1D case and in 2D finger-type flows are interpreted as a consequence of hysteresis of conductivity depending on water content. The estimations made allow the description of fingering as a result of hysteresis. The mean velocity of hysteretic finger-type flow can be higher than velocity of 1D hysteretic flow while the last advances faster than the usual monotonic front without hysteresis.}

Once formed, these fingers persist over a long period. In this paper, the formation of fingers and their persistence in initially uniform dry or wet soils are examined. Using fast-responding tensiometers in conjunction with rapid moisture measurements, it is shown that the matric potential at the finger tip and the position of the wetting curve relative to the drying curve are key factors in the persistence of the fingers. In accordance with the earlier observation, the tip and the fringes of the finger are on a wetting curve, while the remaining core of the finger is on a drying branch. This explains why large differences in moisture content can co-exist. This study also shows that the initial water content in and around the finger is crucially important in relation to which particular scanning curve is followed and, thus, to the water contents during infiltration.}

The advantage of this model is that all scanning curves are derived with the aid of simple functions from the main drying curve and the main wetting curves solely. Like the generalized approach of Enderby (1955) the present model takes into account a reversible part of the process. A simple method of predicting the first drying curve and the scanning curves branched out of the first drying curve is also proposed. Results based on this model are compared with laboratory measurements and the general Néel-Everett independent domain model. The comparison shows that the present model is often in more satisfactory agreement with measurements for cases in which the prediction based on the Néel-Everett model is poor. The suggested method can be used for solving problems in which hysteresis plays a significant role, the difficulties associated with laboratory determination of the ψ-θ relationships in the whole domain thus being avoided.},

Only the boundary curves of the main loop are required in order to derive analytically the scanning curves. The reliability of the proposed modified model is demonstrated by a comparison of the predicted scanning curves with the measured ones.

The penalty boundary method (PBM) is introduced as a method that significantly reduces the time required for generating finite element models because the mesh is not required to conform to the CAD geometry. The PBM also eliminates discretization error as boundary conditions are applied using CAD geometry directly rather than an approximation of the geometry. The PBM employs penalty methods to apply boundary conditions on a simple, regular mesh."

abstract = {Abstract Water-repellent soils occur all over the world and affect both groundwater pollution and crop yield. The finger-like wetting patterns in these soils have many similarities with unstable wetting fronts in coarse-grained sandy soils. Our objectives were to study the water movement in water-repellent sand and to examine how the theory for unstable wetting fronts applies to water-repellent sands. Infiltration experiments, in which moisture content and matric potentials were measured, were carried out in slab chambers with identical sands but with different levels of water repellence. Soil water characteristics were determined in separate experiments. Infiltration in the hydrophilic soil resulted in a uniform and horizontal front. All water-repellent sands showed a fingered flow pattern. For negative water-entry values, water infiltrated without delay. For positive values, water entered the soil only after the depth of the ponded water equaled or exceeded the water-entry pressure, which increased with increasing repellency. The finger widths predicted with the unstable flow theory agreed rather well with the observed values. In general, the research showed that the wetting patterns of water-repellent sands depended directly on the soil water characteristic curve. This implies that the type of wetting front and risk to groundwater pollution can be predicted based on laboratory-measured soil hydraulic properties.},

abstract = {Descriptions of fingered flow typically are based on linear instability theory, which becomes inappropriate once a finger has formed. In contrast, we obtain a self-similar solution to a moving finger with a curved interface by using the dynamic capillary pressure, where the capillary pressure depends on the velocity of the moving interface. From this solution we find analytical expressions for the shape and width of gravitationally driven fingers when they are fully developed. The solution has an unphysical limit of zero width at the limit of zero velocity owing to the simple dependence of capillary pressure on velocity. We discuss modifications to this dependence and compare the results to previous observations of fingering by Glass et al. [1989].},

We design and numerically validate a recovery based linear finite element method for solving the biharmonic equation. The main idea is to replace the gradient operator $\nabla$ on linear finite element space by $G(\nabla)$ in the weak formulation of the biharmonic equation, where $G$ is the recovery operator which recovers the piecewise constant function into the linear finite element space. By operator $G$, Laplace operator $\Delta$ is replaced by $\nabla\cdot G(\nabla)$. Furthermore, the boundary condition on normal derivative $\nabla u\cdot \pmb{n}$ is treated by the boundary penalty method. The explicit matrix expression of the proposed method is also introduced. Numerical examples on the uniform and adaptive meshes are presented to illustrate the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed method.

	An upwind mixed finite element method is proposed on changing meshes for solving a positive semi-definite miscible displacement problem of Darcy-Forchheimer flow in three-dimensional porous media. The pressure and velocity could be obtained together by using a mixed finite element, and the computational accuracy of velocity is improved. The concentration equation is solved by the upwind mixed finite element scheme on changing meshes, where the upwind approximation and an expanded mixed finite element are adopted for the convection and diffusion, respectively. It solves the convection-dominated diffusion problem well and has the following improvements. First, the conservation of mass, an important physical nature, is preserved. Second, it has high order computational accuracy. An optimal-order error estimates is concluded. Numerical experiments illustrate the efficiency and application of the presented scheme.

	A convolutional neural network is developed for rapidly predicting multiphase flow in heterogeneous porous media. Some direct numerical methods can acquire accurate results of multiphase flow in porous media. However, once the geometry of the porous media changes, it takes much computational time to perform a new simulation. Here, a deep neural network model in the field of semantic segmentation is developed. It takes the two-dimensional microstructure of heterogeneous porous media as inputs and is able to predict corresponding multiphase flow fields (pressure and saturation fields). Compared to the direct lattice Boltzmann simulations, the inference time on new geometry of porous media can be reduced by several orders of magnitude. Our results show that the machine learning method is a good prediction tool in a wide range of porosity and heterogeneity. Besides, to better understand the inherent process, a visible explanation is presented on what our neural networks have learned.

	abstract = {Infiltration into well-sorted sands can show an anomalous behavior called saturation overshoot where the saturation at the infiltrating front is higher than the saturation behind the front for certain fluxes and initial water contents. Similarly, capillary pressure overshoot is defined as when the capillary pressure is greater behind the front than it is at the front, which is contrary to normal infiltration. In this paper, pressure profiles are reported for water infiltrating into sand for a range of fluxes and initial water content. Capillary pressure overshoot is observed for sands with an initial water saturation of 0.06 and less, while no overshoot is observed for greater initial saturations. Capillary pressure overshoot does not show much dependence on flux, but the capillary pressure at the front does decrease with increasing flux. These results are combined with the previous saturation measurements, and it is found that the capillary pressure-saturation imbibition curve is not dependent on the velocity of the front. The implications of the results on the stability of three-dimensional flows are discussed.},

For homogenous porous media, infiltrations are sometimes observed to be stable and laterally uniform, but other times are observed to be unstable and produce preferential flow paths. Since Saffman and Taylor (1958), researchers have attempted to define criteria that determine instability. Saffman and Taylor's analysis consisted of two regions of single phase flow, while Parlange and Hill (1976) integrated this analysis with the multiphase flow equations to provide testable predictions. In the subsequent 40 years, great advances have been made determining the complex interactions between multiphase flow and instability. Theoretically, the stability of the standard multiphase flow equations has been verified, showing the necessity of extensions to the multiphase flow equations to describe the observed unstable flow. Experimentally, it has been shown that the instability is related to a phenomena in 1-D infiltrations called saturation or pressure overshoot. In this review, the connection between overshoot and instability is detailed, and it is described how models of overshoot can simplify the analysis of current and future models of instability and multiphase flow.},

In the h-method, the overall method contains two parts, a solution algorithm and a mesh selection algorithm. These two parts are independent of each other in the sense that the change of the PDEs will affect the first part only. However, in some of the existing versions of the r-method (also known as the moving mesh method), these two parts are strongly associated with each other and as a result any change of the PDEs will result in the rewriting of the whole code. In this work, we will propose a moving mesh method which also contains two parts, a solution algorithm and a mesh-redistribution algorithm. Our efforts are to keep the advantages of the r-method (e.g., keep the number of nodes unchanged) and of the h-method (e.g., the two parts in the code are independent). A framework for adaptive meshes based on the Hamiltonâ€“Schoenâ€“Yau theory was proposed by Dvinsky. In this work, we will extend Dvinsky's method to provide an efficient solver for the mesh-redistribution algorithm. The key idea is to construct the harmonic map between the physical space and a parameter space by an iteration procedure. Each iteration step is to move the mesh closer to the harmonic map. This procedure is simple and easy to program and also enables us to keep the map harmonic even after long times of numerical integration. The numerical schemes are applied to a number of test problems in two dimensions. It is observed that the mesh-redistribution strategy based on the harmonic maps adapts the mesh extremely well to the solution without producing skew elements for multi-dimensional computations."

As the oscillation is removed, either through grid refinement or the use of inherently monotone schemes, the numerically generated fingers disappear, and the solution becomes monotonic. Thus the RE along with standard monotonic hydraulic properties does not contain the critical physics required to model gravity-driven fingers and must be considered inadequate for unsaturated flow in initially dry, highly nonlinear, and hysteretic media where these fingers occur.},

ABSTRACT = {Modeling water flow and solute transport in the vadose zone is essential to understanding the fate of soil pollutants and their travel times towards groundwater bodies. It also helps design better irrigation strategies to control solute concentrations and fluxes in semiarid and arid regions. Heterogeneity, soil texture and wetting front instabilities determine the flow patterns and solute transport mechanisms in dry soils. When water is already present in the soil, the flow of an infiltration pulse depends on the spatial distribution of soil water and on its mobility. We present numerical simulations of passive solute transport during unstable infiltration of water into sandy soils that are prone to wetting front instability. We study the impact of the initial soil state, in terms of spatial distribution of water content, on the infiltration of a solute-rich water pulse. We generate random fields of initial moisture content with spatial structure, through multigaussian fields with prescribed correlation lengths. We characterize the patterns of water flow and solute transport, as well as the mass fluxes through the soil column. Our results indicate a strong interplay between preferential flow and channeling due to fingering and the spatial distribution of soil water at the beginning of infiltration. Fingering and initial water saturation fields have a strong effect on solute diffusion and dilution into the ambient water during infiltration, suggesting an effective separation between mobile and inmobile transport domains that are controlled by the preferential flow paths due to fingering.},

	abstract = {We present a phase field model of infiltration that explains the formation of gravity fingers during water infiltration in soil. The model is an extension of the traditional Richards equation, and it introduces a new term, a fourth-order derivative in space, but not a new parameter. We propose a scaling that links the magnitude of the new term to the relative strength of gravity-to-capillary forces already present in Richards' equation. We exploit the thermodynamic framework to design a flow potential that constrains the water saturation to be between 0 and 1, its physically admissible values. The model predicts a saturation overshoot at the wetting front, which is in good agreement with experimental measurements. Two-dimensional numerical simulations predict gravity fingers with the appearance and characteristics observed in visual laboratory experiments. A linear stability analysis of the model shows that there is a direct relation between saturation overshoot and the strength of the front instability. Therefore our theory supports the conjecture that saturation overshoot, a pileup of water at the wetting front, is a prerequisite for gravity fingering.},

Although the phenomenon of unstable infiltration is well known, its description using continuum mathematical models has posed a significant challenge for several decades. The classical model of water flow in the unsaturated flow, the Richards equation, is unable to reproduce the instability. Here, we present a computational study of a model of unsaturated flow in porous media that extends the Richards equation and is capable of predicting the instability and captures the key features of gravity fingering quantitatively. The extended model is based on a phase-field formulation and is fourth-order in space. The new model poses a set of challenges for numerical discretizations, such as resolution of evolving interfaces, stiffness in space and time, treatment of singularly perturbed equations, and discretization of higher-order spatial partial–differential operators. We develop a numerical algorithm based on Isogeometric Analysis, a generalization of the finite element method that permits the use of globally-smooth basis functions, leading to a simple and efficient discretization of higher-order spatial operators in variational form. We illustrate the accuracy, efficiency and robustness of our method with several examples in two and three dimensions in both homogeneous and strongly heterogeneous media. We simulate, for the first time, unstable gravity-driven infiltration in three dimensions, and confirm that the new theory reproduces the fundamental features of water infiltration into a porous medium. Our results are consistent with classical experimental observations that demonstrate a transition from stable to unstable fronts depending on the infiltration flux."

  abstract =  {It is well known that the relationship between capillary pressure and saturation, in two-phase flow problems demonstrates memory effects and, in particular, hysteresis. Explicit representation of full hysteresis with a myriad of scanning curves in models of multiphase flow has been a difficult problem. A second complication relates to the fact that Pc–S relationships, determined under static conditions, are not necessarily valid in dynamics. There exist Pc–S relationships which take into account dynamic effects. But the combination of hysteretic and dynamic effects in the capillary relationship has not been considered yet. In this paper, we have developed new models of capillary hysteresis which also include dynamic effects. In doing so, thermodynamic considerations are employed to ensure the admissibility of the new relationships. The simplest model is constructed around main imbibition and drainage curves and assumes that all scanning curves are vertical lines. The dynamic effect is taken into account by introducing a damping coefficient in Pc–S equation. A second-order model of hysteresis with inclined scanning curves is also developed. The simplest version of proposed models is applied to two-phase incompressible flow and an example problem is solved.},

In the second case, the permeability function k is strictly positive, but the capillary pressure function can be multi-valued. In both cases, the degenerate behavior of pc leads to the physically desired uniform bounds for the saturation variable. Our approach exploits maximum principles and relies on the corresponding uniform bounds for pressure and saturation. A new compactness result for the saturation variable allows to take limits in nonlinear terms. The solution concept uses tools of convex analysis."

The second paper of the series discussed the application of this analysis to the stability of several soil water systems, some of which were potentially unstable. These included redistribution following infiltration, infiltration into a scale heterogeneous medium, and infiltration into a fine-over-coarse stratified profile. Although instability was expected for these systems and a noticeable trend toward instability was present, the numerical results did not predict the occurrence of such a condition. There was evidence to suggest that small amounts of initial water could have a significant effect on the damping out of instabilities that would occur under dry initial conditions. The present paper studies the effect of initial water content and grain size on wetting front instability by using a series of simple experiments. Results are presented for redistribution following infiltration for three porous materials, initially in a dry condition, and for three wetting depths prior to the onset of the redistribution phase. In addition, for the coarsest of these porous materials, a similar series of infiltration-redistribution experiments is conducted with varying amounts of initial water present. Results are also presented for the effect of initial water content on infiltration into a stratified profile. The experiments show quite clearly that even small amounts of initial water have a strongly inhibiting effect on the development of frontal instability patterns.},

Preferential flow in water-repellent sands. Soil Sci. Soc. Am. J. 62, 1185–1190]. These experiments demonstrate that water repellency has a significant impact on the stability of flow. As a follow up to these experiments, numerical solutions of the Richards equation for a two-dimensional domain are derived to examine the effect of water repellency on flow characteristics. Of particular interest is the development of gravity-driven unstable flow conditions caused by water repellency. The degree of water repellency of the porous medium is manifested in the water saturation—capillary pressure and water saturation—hydraulic conductivity relationships for the porous medium. To derive the numerical solutions, parameters closely representing the flow domain boundary conditions and the porous medium properties in the experiments of Bauters et al., were employed. In this paper we present the results of simulations for two cases: a water wettable sand and an extremely water repellent sand. The numerical solution for the water wettable sand led to a stable flow condition, while for the water-repellent sand the flow was unstable as manifested by the development of a single finger of flow. A new feature of these modeling results, in comparison to previous modeling results for gravity-driven unstable flow, is that the water pressure inside the finger core is positive. In testing the numerical solutions we compared the solution results to the laboratory results in terms of flow patterns, water pressure at a single reference point, and wetting front velocity. The degree of agreement between the laboratory results and the numerical solutions in terms of these measures is quite good.}

Both water content and matric potential were measured. Water content was measured with Synchrotron X-rays at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) and matric potential with fast responding tensiometers. The flow field changed gradually from unstable fingered flow at 0% initial water content to a wetting pattern that can be described with Richards’ equation without hysteresis. For unstable flow, the matric potential and water content decreased a short distance behind the wetting front. Except in the initially dry soil, the finger pattern began to widen immediately after infiltration. The pressure and water content of the wetting front were hyperbolically related to the initial water content. In general, this research showed that in coarse soils when an unstable wetting front occurs both the matric potential and water content drop behind the wetting front while, when a stable Richards’ type wetting front forms, the matric potential and water content increase (slightly) behind the wetting front."

	Wetting and redistribution of water in air-dried wettable and water-repellent soils was investigated by tracking the spatial and temporal moisture-content variation in a transparent flow chamber. Water was applied to the soil surface as a point source at three application rates. Contrary to spontaneous penetration into the wettable soil, water ponded on the water-repellent soils prior to penetration. The interplay of water-repellency degree and water-application rate had a substantial effect on the shape and dimensions of the plume. The horizontal expansion of the wetting front in repellent soils beyond the ultimate pond width was small and did not obey the t1/2 horizontal capillary-dependent flow. Moisture content throughout the plume in the repellent soils was high and gradually increased with depth (saturation overshoot), indicating an unstable flow shaping finger-like wetting fronts. Moisture redistribution was mainly in the vertical direction, leaving a wet region at the location of the plume tip when redistribution started.}

A constitutive theory is developed resulting in balance equations and thermodynamics appropriate for modelling multiphase flow in porous media. Volume fractions of phases and areal fractions of interfaces are explicitly included in the theory. Incorporation of the interface equations into the theory allows for a complete description of the problem. The manipulations provide explicit functional dependence of the capillary pressure.

This advance offers the potential for improved understanding and modeling of multiphase flow processes. To provide background for this work, the traditional approach to describing two-phase flow in porous media is reviewed. The universally employed empirical extension of Darcy's Law for single-phase flow to two-phase flow situations is rejected as arbitrary and subject to severe shortcomings. Burial of dynamic effects into relative permeability and capillary pressure hysteresis is shown to be an unsatisfactory theoretical construct for modeling the actual processes occurring in two-phase flow. Examination of the traditional theory at equilibrium shows that interfacial forces actually present in multiphase systems have been overlooked causing the theory to provide contradictory results. To overcome these problems, a general theory of two-phase flow is proposed that is based on the basic principles of mass, momentum, and energy conservation and the second law of thermodynamics. This theory accounts, in a systematic way, for interfacial forces that are known to have an important effect on the movement of fluid phases in a porous medium. A new equation of momentum balance accounting for the presence of interfaces and their energetics is developed. This equation reduces to Darcy's Law for the special case of single-phase flow. The extended theory has the potential to describe phenomena unaccounted for by the traditional theory and thus provides a basis for scientific understanding of the physics of two-phase flow. Application of the theory requires experimental study to ascertain the values and precise functional dependence of the constitutive coefficients that arise."

	abstract = {Capillary pressure plays a central role in the description of water flow in unsaturated soils. While capillarity is ubiquitous in unsaturated analyses, the theoretical basis and practical implications of capillarity in soils remain poorly understood. In most traditional treatments of capillary pressure, it is defined as the difference between pressures of phases, in this case air and water, and is assumed to be a function of saturation. Recent theories have indicated that capillary pressure should be given a more general thermodynamic definition, and its functional dependence should be generalized to include dynamic effects. Experimental evidence has slowly accumulated in the past decades to support a more general description of capillary pressure that includes dynamic effects. A review of these experiments shows that the coefficient arising in the theoretical analysis can be estimated from the reported data. The calculated values range from 104 to 107 kg (m s)−1 In addition, recently developed pore-scale models that simulate interface dynamics within a network of pores can also be used to estimate the appropriate dynamic coefficients. Analyses of experiments reported in the literature, and of simulations based on pore-scale models, indicate a range of dynamic coefficients that spans about three orders of magnitude. To examine whether these coefficients have any practical effects on larger-scale problems, continuum-scale simulators may be constructed in which the dynamic effects are included. These simulators may then be run to determine the range of coefficients for which discernable effects occur. Results from such simulations indicate that measured values of dynamic coefficients are within one order of magnitude of those values that produce significant effects in field simulations. This indicates that dynamic effects may be important for some field situations, and numerical simulators for unsaturated flow should generally include the additional term(s) associated with dynamic capillary pressure.},

In addition to the capillary and gravity terms within the traditional Richards equation, the HDE contains a hypodiffusive term that models an experimentally observed hold-back-pile-up (HBPU) effect and thus imparts nonmonotonicity at the wetting front. In its dimensionless form the HDE contains the dimensionless hypodiffusion number, NHD. As NHD increases, one-dimensional (1D) numerical solutions transition from monotonic to nonmonotonic. Considering the experimentally observed controls on GDF occurrence, as either the initial moisture content and applied flux increase or the material nonlinearity decreases, solutions undergo the required transition back to monotonic. Additional tests for horizontal imbibition and capillary rise show the HDE to yield the required monotonic response but display sharper fronts for NHD > 0. Finally, two-dimensional (2D) numerical solutions illustrate that in parameter space where the 1D HDE yields nonmonotonicity, in 2D it forms nonmonotonic GDF.},

We postulate the HBPU effect is tied to wetting front sharpness and can be mathematically formulated in a variety of ways to include hypodiffusive, hyperbolic, and mixed spatial-temporal forms involving respectively a Laplacian, a second-order derivative in time, and a Laplacian of a first-order derivative in time of the state variables. For each, we can infer an extended flux relation comprised of the Darcy-Buckingham flux plus an additional component due to the HBPU effect.

Using these constitutive relationships, unstable flow theory developed for coarse grained soils can be used to predict the shape and water content distribution for water repellent soils. A practical result of this paper is that with a basic experimental setup, we can characterize the imbibing front behavior by measuring the water entry pressure and the imbibing soil characteristic curve from the same heat treated soil."

	abstract = {Important features of multiphase flow in porous media that distinguish it from single-phase flow are the presence of interfaces between the fluid phases and of common lines where three phases come in contact. Despite this fact, mathematical descriptions of these flows have been lacking in rigor, consisting primarily of heuristic extensions of Darcy's law that include a hysteretic relation between capillary pressure and saturation and a relative permeability coefficient. As a result, the standard capillary pressure concept appears to have physically unrealistic properties. The present paper employs microscopic mass and momentum balance equations for phases and interfaces to develop an understanding of capillary pressure at the microscale. Next, the standard theories and approaches that define capillary pressure at the macroscale are described and their shortcomings are discussed. Finally, an approach is presented whereby capillary pressure is shown to be an intrinsic property of the system under study. In particular, the presence of interfaces and their distribution within a multiphase system are shown to be essential to describing the state of the system. A thermodynamic approach to the definition of capillary pressure provides a theoretically sound alternative to the definition of capillary pressure as a simple hysteretic function of saturation.},

	abstract = {Well-defined laboratory experiments have been carried out to investigate hysteretic dynamic effect in capillary pressure–saturation relationships for two-phase flow in homogeneous and heterogeneous (layered) porous media. Conceptually, the dependence of the capillary pressure curves on the rate of change of saturation (dSw/dt) is defined as the dynamic effect in capillary pressure relationship, which is indicated by a dynamic coefficient, τ (Pa s) and it determines the rate at which two-phase flow equilibrium is reached, i.e., dSw/dt = 0 where Sw and t are the water saturation and time, respectively. The dependences of τ on various fluid and porous materials properties have been studied in the context of drainage; but, there is limited study for imbibition and the hysteresis of τ−Sw relationships. As such, the emphasis in this article is on reporting τ−Sw curves for imbibition while also demonstrating the hysteresis in the τ−Sw relationships by comparing τ−Sw curves for drainage (previously reported) and imbibition (this study) in carefully designed laboratory experiments. Homogeneous sand samples composed of either fine (small particle size and lower permeability) or coarse (larger particle size and higher permeability) sand have been used for these experiments. Furthermore, a layered domain made of a find sand layer sandwiched between two coarse sand layers is used as a model of heterogeneous domain. The results of the study confirm that the τ−Sw relationships are hysteretic in nature and, as such, the speed to flow equilibrium should vary depending on whether drainage or imbibition takes place. At a particular water saturation, the magnitudes of the dynamic coefficient (τ) are found to be generally higher for imbibition, which imply that the speed to flow equilibrium at the same saturation will be slower for imbibition. © 2013 The Authors.

	abstract = {Constant flux infiltration experiments were performed at rates less than saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) on uniform columns of soils and glass beads with low initial water contents. Tensiometers measured matric pressure (ψ) histories at various depths in the 0.05-m diameter, 0.73-m-tall columns. One of two devices applied the steady fluxes: one was a ceramic plate applicator that allowed monitoring of pressures above the plate, and the other was a rain applicator that sprinkled water uniformly over the surface. Two columns were used. One allowed destructive sampling for water content in a way that prevented postrun changes in water content. The other allowed prerun replacement of pore air with gases of different solubilities. Contrary to predictions based on the Richards equation, transmission zone ψ values passed through maxima, then decreased continuously as wetting fronts moved down columns. Such nonideal behavior was observed in Aiken silt loam, Hanfoird sandy loam, Delhi sand, Oakley sand, and glass beads. At an infiltration rate equal to 70\% of Ksat, values of ψ at 2, 5, and 8 cm depths in the glass beads column decreased an average of 52\% from their respective maxima in about 3 hours. In the soil columns the nonmonotonic behavior was less pronounced but statistically significant at all rates examined (3–59\% of Ksat). Matric pressure reversals were larger, and corresponding maxima higher, when a given rate was preceded by a series of step wise increasing rates. Tests of possible explanations provided no evidence to support hypotheses involving trapped-air dynamics, convective air flow, particle rearrangement, or experimental artifacts. The results cast doubt on the ability of the Richards equation to predict the course of constant flux infiltration including the initiation of runoff.},

	abstract = {Gravity-driven fingers in uniform porous medium are known to have a distinctive nonmonotonic saturation profile, with saturated (or nearly so) tips and much less saturation in the tails. In this work, constant-flux infiltrations into confined porous media (laterally smaller than the finger diameter, thus essentially one-dimensional) are found to produce saturation overshoot identical to that found in gravity-driven fingers. Light transmission is used to measure the saturation profiles as a function of infiltrating flux, porous media grain size, grain sphericity, and initial water saturation. Saturation overshoot is found to cease below a certain minimum infiltrating flux. This minimum flux depends greatly on the grain sphericity and initial water content of the media and slightly on the mean grain size. The observed saturation overshoot is inconsistent with a continuum description of porous media but qualitatively matches well observations and predictions from discrete pore-filling mechanisms. This suggests that pore-scale physics controls saturation overshoot and in turn gravity-driven fingering.},

abstract = {Distinct water-content profiles, having saturated θ-bumps at and immediately behind wetting fronts, were observed in narrow columns (9 mm ID) of homogeneous air-dried glass beads under downward one-dimensional infiltration with applied water fluxes at lower than the saturated hydraulic conductivity. The infiltrating water content profiles and the position of the wetting front as a function of time were also calculated based on Richards' equation using an independently measured hydraulic conductivity function K(θ), and water retention characteristic θ(h), of the drainage process, and by applying a pressure boundary condition, hwe, which is almost atmospheric pressure, at the moving wetting front. The good agreement between the calculated profiles and the observed confirms that the dynamic water entry pressure hwe (where θ(hwe) is the saturated water content), does exist for air-dried glass beads, although it is in contradiction to the modern theory of unsaturated water flow in porous media. This physical property of dry media creates an upward negative pressure profile behind the wetting front that would inevitably produce finger flow if the column diameter were larger. At the wetting front, the water content and pressure should be completely discontinuous at the level of pore size, and hence Darcy's equation cannot be applied across the interface between the air-dried and saturated media.},

	abstract = {Abstract Percolation of a one-dimensional wetting front in homogeneous soil is known to be stable. On the other hand, in a layered soil whose upper layer is finer and less conductive than the coarser layer beneath, the wetting front becomes unstable and breaks into narrow wetting columns, or “fingers,” in which flow is three-dimensional. The instability originates at the interface but takes some time to develop, hence the wetting fingers appear some distance below the interface. The fingers move downward at a velocity equal to the saturated conductivity divided by the saturated volumetric water content of the bottom layer. The fingers consist of a saturated inner core percolating downward surrounded by an unsaturated outer layer. Experimental results indicate that the width of the fingers is independent of the flow rate and of irregularities at the interface. The number of fingers per unit area of interface is directly proportional to the flow rate. Instability of the wetting front in layered soil following rain or irrigation makes it possible for smaller volumes of water to penetrate deeper than would have been possible had the wetting front remained stable.},

	abstract = {Abstract If the velocity of a plane wetting front increases with depth of penetration, then the front will be unstable, i.e., then a small perturbation of an initially plane front will tend to grow. On the basis of a simple hydraulic model due to Green and Ampt, criteria for instability are derived. It is found that decreases of depth of ponding and of capillary pressure head at the wetting front, increases with depth of the hydraulic conductivity and the initial water content, and compression of soil air ahead of the wetting front all have the effect of enhancing instability of the wetting front. The capillary pressure head at the wetting front is proportional to the surface tension and the cosine of the angle of contact of the water-air-soil interface and inversely proportional to the radius of curvature of the air-water interface, which in turn is proportional to the mean size of the soil particles. The analysis is at first restricted to uniform soils and later extended to nonuniform soils. Criteria for instability of flows in layered soils and soils with crusts are included as special cases.},

In the present study the analysis is applied to the stability of several soil water systems some of which are potentially unstable. The first stage in the analysis requires the generation of water content and pressure head profiles using a computer-based numerical solution for the flow equation for unsaturated porous materials. These profiles permit the calculation of certain differential terms which appear in the specification of the coefficients required in the stability analysis. Results for the growth rate of imposed disturbances of wavelengths of 1, 5, and 25 cm together with the appropriate eigenvectors are presented for infiltration into a homogeneous profile, redistribution following infiltration, infiltration into a scale heterogeneous medium, and infiltration into a fine-over-coarse stratified profile. Although instability was expected for the redistribution, heterogeneous, and layered systems, the results, whilst showing a noticeable trend towards instability, did not predict the occurrence of such a condition. The reason for this is discussed, in particular the evidence which suggests that small amounts of initial water can have a significant effect on the damping-out of instabilities that otherwise would occur under dry initial conditions. Reference is made to a projected further paper documenting the effect of initial water content on wetting front instability and to the need for additional numerical studies at very low initial water contents.},

With this nonequilibrium relation the governing equation is referred to as the nonequilibrium Richards equation (NERE). For the special case where the nonequilibrium vanishes, the NERE reduces to the Richards equation (RE), the conventional governing equation for describing unsaturated flow. A generalized linear stability analysis of the RE shows that this equation is unconditionally stable and therefore not able to produce gravity-driven unstable flows for infinitesimal perturbations to the flow field. A much stronger result of unconditional stability for the RE is derived using a nonlinear stability analysis applicable to the general case of heterogeneous porous media. For the general case of the NERE model, results of a linear stability analysis show that the NERE model is conditionally stable, with lower-frequency perturbations being unstable. A result of this analysis is that the nonmonotonicity of the pressure and saturation profile is a requisite condition for flow instability.},

The models considered include the conventional Richards equation (RE), a sharp front Richards equation (SFRE) and an extended Richards equation (RRE). The first two models are based on the use of an equilibrium capillary pressure-saturation function, while the third model is derived using a dynamic capillary pressure-saturation function represented by a relaxation coefficient. A traveling wave solution was formulated for each of the governing equations and used as the basic solution of each model. The stability analysis was based on imposing a small perturbation to the basic solution. The RE model yields only the well-known monotonically decreasing saturation profile toward the wetting front, and the wetting front is unconditionally stable. The SFRE model by its nature has a monotonically increasing saturation profile toward the front and an abrupt drop to the initial saturation. This flow is unconditionally unstable. The RRE model is distinct from the others in that it is the only model that is able to produce truly non-monotonic saturation profiles. The wetting front for the RRE model is conditionally stable, i.e. stable for high frequency perturbations, and unstable otherwise. This leads to the existence of a wave-number for maximum amplification, which should relate to the dimensions of fingers in unstable flow."

The flow rate through the system is systematically varied by using different mean grain size separates for the upper layer (the same coarse separate being used for the bottom layer). Relationships between finger width, propagation velocity, moisture content, and flow rate through individual fingers are experimentally determined and related to the properties of the bottom layer and the flow rate through the system.

We extend the results obtained previously for linear higher order terms and investigate the existence of travelling wave solutions in the non-linear and degenerate case. This case leads to non-smooth travelling waves, as well as to a discontinuous capillary pressure."
